Display stuff
 - get size of screen, make it into 6 equal parts (or whatever)
    - reserve some space for gallery name
 - each part displays a picture, make sure the max dimension of the picture fits within the screen
 - every $interval, swap to a new picture (again ensuring size is legit)


Photoloop
- from $root_dir, find all child_dirs with folders
    - for each child_dir
        - if has child_dir TOP, mark TOP = true in album, remove top from list to explore
        - capture paths to photos and TOP photos
        - capture name of directory for display
        - add album to LIST_TO_SHOW
    
At interval, grab new album
    - from album, get required amount of photos, weighted 70% or so to TOP
        - remember, might be no TOP
    - remove album from LIST_TO_SHOW and add to SHOWED

when all albums have been shown, SHOWED becomes LIST_TO_SHOW, SHOWED is reset to nothing


need to define:
    interval
    images per album
    percent top

Rules:
    - top folders cannot have child albums
